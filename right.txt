A true story

this is a true story about the 3-way merge. It is nice to have a simple
script that can show, how the 3-way merge behaves.
It is not that difficult to get the basic idea. However, a more complex
example may lead to a quite complex code. The basic issue is to compute the diffs well.

End of the story.
